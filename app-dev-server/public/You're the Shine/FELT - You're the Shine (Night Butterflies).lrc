[00:00.00]You're the Shine - FELT
[00:47.60]Nobody knows the way it's gonna be without you no relations
[00:53.33]
[00:54.80]There's cosmic wonder I find
[00:56.62]Stars sing like they're talking
[00:58.10]
[00:58.60]Walk in the cloud ensemble
[01:00.74]
[01:02.34]Just when I closed my eyes and prayed for your brightness
[01:06.87]
[01:07.44]It's my redemption
[01:08.59]
[01:10.05]Streams touched from the rift in the violet cloud
[01:15.30]
[01:15.98]'Cause I feel you're here
[01:18.29]
[01:18.83]Can you hear I'm on close to you
