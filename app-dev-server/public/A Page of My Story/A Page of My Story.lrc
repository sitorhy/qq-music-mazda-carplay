[00:02.14]If days were not the same
[00:04.27]
[00:05.29]I don't know what I'd do
[00:07.64]
[00:08.58]Imagine me laughing and now
[00:11.81]See me walk in the street
[00:13.89]
[00:14.83]Then catch a red double bus
[00:18.22]And heaven would find me
[00:20.72]
[00:21.52]I'd go on a float
[00:24.46]Eased up I smile a dream
[00:27.62]
[00:30.04]Now you know
[00:31.26]There is a scene that I
[00:33.59]
[00:34.64]I repeat in my soul
[00:37.31]
[00:37.89]While sippin' a black tea and now
[00:41.22]Gently touching a tree
[00:43.41]
[00:44.32]Calming hi beam from the sky
[00:47.24]
[00:47.78]Can free me I feel like
[00:50.14]
[00:50.98]I'm getting so close
[00:53.75]To laughing sweet with everything
[00:57.43]
[00:57.97]Goin' out on
[00:59.07]Sunday morning the light has come
[01:02.55]La la morning the light's on me
[01:04.99]And looking up high
[01:05.93]Looking around you'll see all around
[01:09.70]Vanish worries the light has come
[01:12.77]La la shining the light on me
[01:14.30]I'm going to try for a pleasant now
[01:17.28]Taking me high up I'm free
[01:18.71]Just a page of life in my story
[01:23.30]Sweet and bright
[01:26.62]
[01:37.43]There is a comfort to all
[01:39.84]
[01:40.73]And affection reside
[01:43.96]In everything that's in my sight
[01:47.29]Finally opened my eyes
[01:49.70]
[01:50.37]And now this I realize
[01:53.26]
[01:53.96]That pleasure can find you
[01:55.88]
[01:56.91]So pleasing to see
[01:59.84]It's like the world is born again
[02:03.35]
[02:04.06]Goin' out on
[02:05.26]Sunday morning the light has come
[02:08.72]La la morning the light's on me
[02:10.38]And looking up high
[02:11.57]Looking around you'll see all around
[02:15.54]Forget worries to laugh and smile
[02:18.84]La la shining the light on me
[02:20.71]And I could fly up and come back around
[02:23.24]Taking me high up I'm free
[02:24.56]
[02:44.47]I've been lonely the light was gone
[02:48.14]La la you've been alone and you'd cry
[02:50.14]When nothing was right
[02:51.06]Nothing was right to me all alone
[02:55.05]Every worry and trial become
[02:57.97]La la walking along you'll see
[02:59.35]A story in life like a treasure found
[03:02.23]Soon to be high up and free
[03:03.97]Sunday morning the light has come
[03:07.68]La la morning the light's on me
[03:09.43]And looking up high
[03:10.63]Looking around you'll see all around
[03:14.34]Vanish worries the light has come
[03:17.67]La la shining the light on me
[03:18.93]I'm going to try for a pleasant now
[03:22.36]Taking me high up I'm free
[03:23.63]Till the time I see this once again
[03:28.31]I'll get by
